SDLC(Software Development Life Cycle)

Definition:

    SDLC is a structured process followed by software development teams to design, develop, test, and deploy high-quality software efficiently and effectively.

Phases of SDLC:

1. Requirement Gathering & Analysis:

    --> Meet with stakeholders to understand business needs.
    --> Analyze requirements for feasibility and scope.
    --> Output: Software Requirement Specification (SRS)

2. Design

    --> Architects/designers create a blueprint of the system.
    --> Includes UI/UX design, database structure, system architecture.
    --> Output: High-Level Design (HLD) and Low-Level Design (LLD)

3. Implementation (Coding)

    --> Developers write code based on the design documents.
    --> Follows coding standards and practices
    --> Output: Working software modules

4. Testing

    --> Testers verify the software for bugs, errors, and defects.
    --> Includes Unit, Integration, System, and Acceptance testing.
    --> Output: Test Reports and Bug Logs

5. Deployment

    --> Software is released to the live environment.
    --> May be done in phases (pilot/beta/production).

6. Maintenance

    -->Post-deployment support, bug fixes, performance improvements.
    -->Involves updates and enhancements.
