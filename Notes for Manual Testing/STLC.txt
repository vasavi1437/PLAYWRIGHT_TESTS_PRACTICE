STLC â€“ Software Testing Life Cycle

Definition:

    STLC is a sequence of specific activities conducted during the testing process to ensure software quality objectives are met. It starts as soon as the requirements are available and continues through test closure.

Phases of STLC:

1. Requirement Analysis

    --> Understand and analyze testing requirements from the SRS or BRD.
    --> Identify testable and non-testable parts.
    --> Output: Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM)

2. Test Planning

    --> Define scope, objective, strategy, and resource allocation.
    --> Estimate effort and schedule testing timelines.
    --> Output: Test Plan Document

3.  Test Case Design / Test Design

    --> Write detailed test cases and test scripts.
    --> Prepare test data.
    --> Output: Test Cases, Test Scenarios, and Test Data

4.  Test Environment Setup

    --> Set up hardware and software to execute tests.
    --> Simulate production-like environment.
    --> Output: Environment Ready for Testing

5.  Test Execution

    --> Execute the written test cases.
    --> Compare expected vs actual results.
    --> Output: Test Execution Report, Defect Log

6.  Defect Reporting & Tracking:

    --> Log bugs found during test execution.
    --> Track, retest, and close fixed defects.

7.  Test Closure:

    --> Finalize testing after all test cases are executed and bugs are fixed.
    --> Prepare test summary and lessons learned.
    --> Output: Test Summary Report, Metrics
